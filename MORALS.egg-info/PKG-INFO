# MORALS:  *Mo*rse Graph-aided discovery of *R*egions of *A*ttraction in a learned *L*atent *S*pace 

Based on the paper: MORALS: Analysis of High-Dimensional Robot Controllers via Topological Tools in a Latent Space


This package implements autoencoders for high-dimensional dynamical systems. It also provides utilities for using the autoencoders to construct a Morse Graph in the learned latent space.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Ewerton-Vieira/MORALS.git
cd MORALS
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
The `examples` directory contains an example of how to collect data and train an autoencoder for a some systems.
